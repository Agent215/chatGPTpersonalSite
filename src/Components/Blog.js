                            I created this website with the help of a powerful AI assistant. I asked the assistant a few questions, such as how to create a React blog component using React Bootstrap, and it provided me with clear, concise answers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was impressed by the assistant's knowledge and ability to generate human-like text on the fly. It's truly amazing what AI can do these days!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, I'm very happy with the results of using AI to help me create this website. It saved me a lot of time and effort, and I'm excited to see what else I can do with it.

                        Today, I spent some time working on my personal website and I wanted to create a nice title component to use on the splash screen. I decided to use Google Fonts to add some personality to the text, and after trying out a few different options, I finally settled on the Rubik 80s Fade font.                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I imported the font into my React component using the @import rule in my CSS, and then applied it to the text using the font-family property. I also added some styling to make the font larger and bolder, and used some emoji's to give it a fun, playful vibe.                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I was really happy with how the title component turned out, and I think it will really help to make my website stand out. In the end, I was also able to use the Accordion component from the react-bootstrap library to create a stylish and functional way to display my blog posts. Overall, it was a really productive day of work on my website and I'm excited to see how everything comes together in the end.                        </p>
